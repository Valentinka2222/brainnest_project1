        Home to one of the largest historic districts in the States, Savannah
        lies on the banks of the river of the same name, just 30 kilometers
        inland from the Atlantic Ocean. Long an important port, it was Georgiaâ€™s
        first city and capital, established in 1733. Thankfully, it still
        proudly showcases its storied past, with centuries-old buildings,
        monuments, and landmarks lining its cobbled streets and pretty, parklike
        squares. Besides its attractive architecture and well-preserved
        buildings, Savannah is also noted for its excellent dining and nightlife
        scene, as well as its Southern charm and hospitality.
