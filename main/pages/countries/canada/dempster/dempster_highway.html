        The Dempster Highway is 450 miles of gravel-topped adventure as it winds
        north from Dawson City through the Ogilvie and Richardson Mountains,
        past the Arctic Circle and tundra scenery, river ferries, roadside
        grizzlies, endless sun, and rugged backcountry camping in Tombstone
        Territorial Park. Here, you can hike through land barely explored by
        humans—meaning it’s practically free from pollution. Just find some land
        away from the highway and start exploring. And, of course, keep your
        gaze upward for a tremendous light show.
