        The deep natural sinkholes are very often found in Mexico. Chichén
        Itzá’s two pits are especially beautiful and popular among the tourists,
        since the city itself is very interesting and worth visiting. Sacred
        Cenote serves not only as a natural wonder, but as a historic spot, as
        well. The sinkhole was visited by the pilgrims, who would sacrifice
        objects and sometimes humans for the god of rain. Very well preserved
        materials were later found in the bottom of the pit.
