        El Castillo or the Temple of Kukulcan is the most famous and
        recognizable landmark of the Mayan era. It is estimated that the pyramid
        was built between the 9th and 12th centuries. It attracts thousands of
        tourists every year. The pyramid embodies astronomical cycles, that
        Mayan were familiar with. During the equinoxes, twice a year, a
        wonderful phenomena occurs, attracting even more spectators: as the sun
        sets, a snake appears, meandering down the 365 steps, that each
        represent one day of the year. Why to go there? You can visit the site
        individually or hire a guide. One of the greatest and most famous
        historic monuments in the world.
