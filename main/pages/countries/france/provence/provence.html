        Every summer, the seemingly endless ocean of lavender fields makes
        Provence one of the most beautiful – not to mention, fragrant – places
        to visit in France. The heavenly scented crop can be found almost
        everywhere in the region during this time. That said, some of the most
        scenic spots to enjoy it include the Valensole Plateau, the Sault
        Plateau, and the Luberon Valley. For the ultimate postcard shot, though,
        nothing beats the flower fields surrounding the Notre-Dame de Sénanque
        Abbey. Nestled in the tranquil countryside near the village of Gordes,
        the stunning 12th-century church is shrouded in a sea of purple every
        June and July. Along with the local honeybees, these beautiful lavender
        fields are lovingly tended by the monks that live in the abbey. In fact,
        visitors can even stay with them and enjoy a serene spiritual retreat.
        If you prefer to keep it to a day trip, however, the fields are open
        from 09:30 during the summertime; and 13:00 on Sundays. Just bear in
        mind that the unique beauty of the location means that it becomes
        extremely busy during this time. Therefore, make sure you arrive early
        and join the first tour of the day at 10:30.
