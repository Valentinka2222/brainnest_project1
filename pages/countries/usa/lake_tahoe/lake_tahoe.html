      Nestled amid the Sierra Nevada mountains, with lush forests, small cities
      and towns lining its scenic shores, Lake Tahoe straddles the states of
      California and Nevada. The largest alpine lake in North America, it has
      long been a popular tourist destination due to its spectacular scenery and
      wealth of recreational activities. Besides hiking, horseback riding, and
      camping in the surrounding landscapes, visitors can go swimming or sailing
      on the lake or relax and unwind on one of its beaches. The Nevada side has
      lots of casinos and resorts, while the more peaceful and picturesque Tahoe
      City and South Lake Tahoe offer fun, family-friendly activities.
