      Home to one of the largest historic districts in the States, Savannah lies
      on the banks of the river of the same name, just 30 kilometers inland from
      the Atlantic Ocean. Long an important port, it was Georgiaâ€™s first city
      and capital, established in 1733. Thankfully, it still proudly showcases
      its storied past, with centuries-old buildings, monuments, and landmarks
      lining its cobbled streets and pretty, parklike squares. Besides its
      attractive architecture and well-preserved buildings, Savannah is also
      noted for its excellent dining and nightlife scene, as well as its
      Southern charm and hospitality.
