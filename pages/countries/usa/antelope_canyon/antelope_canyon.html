        Located just to the east of Page, the attractive and awe-inspiring
        Antelope Canyon lies in the north of Arizona, not far from Lake Powell.
        Meandering magically through desolate landscapes, the spectacular slot
        canyon is a photographer’s dream: its sandstone walls appear to flow
        like water. Made up of two separate sections known as ‘The Crack’ and
        ‘The Corkscrew’, its captivating corridors and chasms are often
        beautifully bathed in brilliant beams of light, enhancing its soft tones
        and shapes. A very popular place, Antelope Canyon can only be visited as
        part of a guided tour as it lies within a Navajo Tribal Park.
