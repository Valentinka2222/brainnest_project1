      North Queensland isn’t just about the reef – the region is also home to
      untouched rainforest. Just an hour’s drive north of Cairns, the Daintree
      is brimming with ancient vegetation and rare Australian wildlife,
      including a healthy population of saltwater crocodiles. Be careful where
      you swim.
