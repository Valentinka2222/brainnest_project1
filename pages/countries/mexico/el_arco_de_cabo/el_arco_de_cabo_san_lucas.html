      A unique group of rock formations is found near Los Cabos Corridor – a
      popular tourist destination due to its many beaches and resorts. In 16th
      century pirates would hide behind these rocks and lurk for the Spanish
      ships, loaded with valuables. Why to go there? The gorgeous rocks are very
      often visited by the vacationers. The easiest way to get there is by
      getting a water taxi, that will give you a tour, drop you at an intimate
      Lover’s Beach and take you after a while. You will also get to see the
      colony of sea lions, that gather at El Arco de Cabo San Lucas.
