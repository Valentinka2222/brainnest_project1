      The striking coastal area is surrounded with red mountains, features eight
      beaches and a turquoise lagoon. Busy city of La Paz is found nearby,
      making Balandra a pleasant getaway from urban hustle and bustle. Crystal
      clear water in the lagoon usually reaches 30° C and is perfect for
      exploring diverse marine life: corals and hundreds of species of colorful
      fish attract scuba divers. It is also perfect for swimming and sun bathing
      on soft white sand. Why to go there? Unspoiled nature is preserved in
      Balandra and no tourist facilities, apart from a few restaurants and
      diving rentals, are developed. A truly stunning getaway.
